<div style="text-align: center"><h3>This webpage will include two main topics for my final project:
genealogy services at the library and meet the staff.</h3></div>

<h2>Genealogy Services</h2>

<p>This section will include information on our genealogy services offered at the St. Louis County Library.</p>

<ol type="1">
    <li> List of classes </li>
    <li> Online resources </li>
    <li> Special collections </li>
    <li> Contact information </li>
</ol>

<h2>Meet the Staff</h2>

<p>This section will feature information about staff.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Blogs or interests</li>
    <li>Basic profiles</li>
    <li>Contact information</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like this section to feature key staff in the department. This could allow visitors to become familiar with staff they would be
working with. I would include myself as somewhat as an ambassador to the department first. The potential would be to add staff as the webpage
grew. This would be a way to introduce themselves and their key interests and expertise in this field. An example may look like:</p>

<h3>Meet Chelsea</h3>

<p>Welcome, Friends! My name is Chelsea and I am new to the genealogy department. My ancestry is English and German. My expertise is in the Appalachian region of the United States
where I focus on vital records, the railroad industry, and the Civil War.</p>
